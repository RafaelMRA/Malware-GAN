# Malware-GAN
This is a realization of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05983">"Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN"</a>
The reaserch is done in Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Summer 2018. http://english.ia.cas.cn/ with the help of my mentor XuBo.

## Introduction
The idea is to use a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm to generate adversarial malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based detection models.
